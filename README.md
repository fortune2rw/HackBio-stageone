# 🧬 Protein Molecular Weight & GC Content Calculator in R

# Overview

This repository contains simple, reusable R functions for performing two common bioinformatics calculations:

Protein molecular weight calculation (kDa) based on amino acid composition

GC content calculation (%) for nucleotide sequences

These tools are designed for beginners in bioinformatics and demonstrate good programming practices such as input normalization, vectorized operations, and modular function design.

# Features

Uses standard biological conventions (one-letter amino acid codes)

Case-insensitive input handling

Clean, readable, and well-documented R code

Suitable for coursework, HackBio internships, and learning pipelines

Easily extendable to batch processing or FASTA files
